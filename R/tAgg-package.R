#' tAgg (time Aggregation): Time aggregation of vector, matrices or data.frames.
#' 
#' This package contains a single function \code{tAgg} to perform time aggregation
#' from a source time series to a time aggregated time series. Given a time vector
#' and a vector/matrix/data.frame of values, it computes the time aggregated
#' values at a given target time interval (e.g. "days", "month", "years", etc.).
